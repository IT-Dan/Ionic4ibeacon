# IBeacon

```
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ibeacon
$ npm install @ionic-native/ibeacon
```

## [Usage Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/ibeacon/)

Plugin Repo: [https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon](https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon)

This plugin provides functions for working with iBeacons.

 The plugin's API closely mimics the one exposed through the [CLLocationManager](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/index.html) introduced in iOS 7.

## Supported platforms
- Android
- iOS

After you're done installing @ionic-native/ibeacon, you will need to replace two files.

- index.js
- ngx/index.js

It's not a perfect solution, but it's working.
