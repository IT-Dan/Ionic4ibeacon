# IBeacon

```
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ibeacon
$ npm install @ionic-native/ibeacon
```

Install the plugins as normal. After you're done installing @ionic-native/ibeacon, you will need to replace two files.

- index.js
- ngx/index.js

It's not a perfect solution, but it's working.

Last tested
